# Warhammer Map
A webpage with a linked map of the warhammer world.

For some time I have been working upon a webpage with a map of the warhammer (fantasy) world with lables for different nations which triggered a popup with some links on (namely for warhammer army poject books but you can do whatever with them.

So far I have run into 1 issue (besides the rubish graphics): the lables move relative to the background image. I think is due to the phenomenon explained at https://css-tricks.com/i-like-how-percentage-background-position-works/ .
